<h1><strong>Caucasian Shepherd </strong></h1>
<h2>Russian Mountain Dog</h2>
<p> For centuries dogs similar to the Caucasian mountain dogs have served 
    shepherds in the Caucasus Mountains as livestock guardian dogs,
    defending sheep from predators, mainly wolves and human sheep-thieves.
    These dogs are distributed over a wide area, and there are considerable regional variations:
    those in Azerbaijan are fairly tall and lightly-built; those in Dagestan are smaller and roughly square in outline; 
    those of the former Checheno-Ingush ASSR, now Ingushetia and Chechnya, are heavily built and very large.
    It is sometimes claimed that those of Georgia are better and more uniform than those of other regions.
