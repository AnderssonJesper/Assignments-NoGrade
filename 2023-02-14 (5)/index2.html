    <h1><strong>Dobermann</strong></h1>
    <h2>The German dog</h2>
    <p>The Dobermann or Doberman Pinscher in the United States and Canada, 
    is a medium-large breed of domestic dog that was originally developed around 1890 by Louis Dobermann,
     a tax collector from Germany. The Dobermann has a long muzzle. It stands on its pads and is not usually
      heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted
       and the tail is docked. However, in some countries, these procedures are now illegal and it is often considered 
        cruel and unnecessary. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.
     Dobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs.
